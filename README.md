# Traveling-Robot-Challenge

Visit a collection of points in the shortest path you can find.  The catch? You have to "go home to recharge" every so often. 

We want fast approximations rather than a brute force perfect solution. Your solution will be judged on:
* the length of path it produces
* fast runtime
* code quality and maintainability

### Details

* There are 5000 points distributed uniformly in [0, 1]
* The recharge station is located at (.5, .5)
* You cannot travel more than 3 units of distance before recharging
* You must start and end at the recharge station
* Skeleton code provided in Python. Python and C++ are acceptable
